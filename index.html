<p>revenues and another to predict if a movie would win an Oscar.
Our first model attempted to predict Box Office Gross Revenues (in 2012 USD) using multiple linear
regression. Our approach was to fit a model using all regressor variables and assess it by looking the
significance of variables based on partial t-tests of significance (p&lt;0.05) and residual analysis. Through
several iterations, we created several models in which non-significant variables were removed and the
response variable was transformed in order to improve the normality of the residuals (log, square root,
cube root and fourth root). Our final model contained 14 significant regressor variables and the fourth
root of the response. We would not recommend use of a linear regression for prediction purposes as we
were only able to achieve an R2 of 0. 0.446 and RMSE which is approximately two-thirds the standard
deviation of the response.
Our second model attempted to predict whether 2012 films would receive an Oscar using multiple logistic
regression of a binary response. Similar to our approach with the first model, we started with all regressor
variables to build a logistic regression model but this time we assessed it not only on the tests of
significance of the variables (p&lt;0.05), but also using an F1 test and model deviance. An F1 test employs
precision and recall and is a more balanced evaluation for our model than raw accuracy, due to the
number of movies with zero Oscars greatly exceeding the number of movies with an Oscar. In our final
model, all variables were significant and showed an F1 score of 0.72 (threshold = 0.6) which was
significantly higher than our first model; none of our models performed well in terms of model deviance,
as none showed a ratio near unity. Finally we, removed to regressor variables which reflected information
not available at the time the Oscar was awarded, i.e., future information; in this model, the F1 score
dropped to 0.52 (threshold = 0.6).</p>
