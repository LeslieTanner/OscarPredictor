Our approach was to fit a model using all regressor variables and assess it by looking the\r\nsignificance of variables based on partial t-tests of significance (p<0.05) and residual analysis. Through\r\nseveral iterations, we created several models in which non-significant variables were removed and the\r\nresponse variable was transformed in order to improve the normality of the residuals (log, square root,\r\ncube root and fourth root). Our final model contained 14 significant regressor variables and the fourth\r\nroot of the response. We would not recommend use of a linear regression for prediction purposes as we\r\nwere only able to achieve an R2 of 0. 0.446 and RMSE which is approximately two-thirds the standard\r\ndeviation of the response.\r\nOur second model attempted to predict whether 2012 films would receive an Oscar using multiple logistic\r\nregression of a binary response. Similar to our approach with the first model, we started with all regressor\r\nvariables to build a logistic regression model but this time we assessed it not only on the tests of\r\nsignificance of the variables (p<0.05), but also using an F1 test and model deviance. An F1 test employs\r\nprecision and recall and is a more balanced evaluation for our model than raw accuracy, due to the\r\nnumber of movies with zero Oscars greatly exceeding the number of movies with an Oscar. In our final\r\nmodel, all variables were significant and showed an F1 score of 0.72 (threshold = 0.6) which was\r\nsignificantly higher than our first model; none of our models performed well in terms of model deviance,\r\nas none showed a ratio near unity. Finally we, removed to regressor variables which reflected information\r\nnot available at the time the Oscar was awarded, i.e., future information; in this model, the F1 score\r\ndropped to 0.52 (threshold = 0.6).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was authored by: Leslie Tanner (@lat7dg), Matthew Hawthorn (@MattHawthorn), Michael Lenart (@mdlenart) and Nikhil Mascarenhas (@nm1291)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
