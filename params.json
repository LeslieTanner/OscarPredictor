We spent a considerable amount of time collecting and preparing data for use in our models. We collected film data, actor data, exchange rate data and inflation data from various websites. Most variables required some adjustment in order to be useful in our models, be it conversion to a factor, imputation of missing values, removal of missing values, standardization to one currency and level of purchasing power, etc. Additionally, in order to deal with non-linearity of data, we performed transformation of some variables, such as squaring numerical variables (actor film appearances, ratings, duration) in an attempt to model nonlinearity in the response variable. We only used complete cases in our models. Our goal was to build two models, one to predict movie revenues and another to predict if a movie would win an Oscar.\r\nOur first model attempted to predict Box Office Gross Revenues (in 2012 USD) using multiple linear regression. Our approach was to fit a model using all regressor variables and assess it by looking the significance of variables based on partial t-tests of significance (p<0.05) and residual analysis. Through several iterations, we created several models in which non-significant variables were removed and the response variable was transformed in order to improve the normality of the residuals (log, square root, cube root and fourth root). Our final model contained 14 significant regressor variables and the fourth root of the response. We would not recommend use of a linear regression for prediction purposes as we were only able to achieve an R2 of 0. 0.446 and RMSE which is approximately two-thirds the standard deviation of the response.\r\nOur second model attempted to predict whether 2012 films would receive an Oscar using multiple logistic regression of a binary response. Similar to our approach with the first model, we started with all regressor variables to build a logistic regression model but this time we assessed it not only on the tests of significance of the variables (p<0.05), but also using an F1 test and model deviance. An F1 test employs precision and recall and is a more balanced evaluation for our model than raw accuracy, due to the number of movies with zero Oscars greatly exceeding the number of movies with an Oscar. In our final model, all variables were significant and showed an F1 score of 0.72 (threshold = 0.6) which was significantly higher than our first model; none of our models performed well in terms of model deviance, as none showed a ratio near unity. Finally we, removed to regressor variables which reflected information not available at the time the Oscar was awarded, i.e., future information; in this model, the F1 score dropped to 0.52 (threshold = 0.6).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was authored by: Leslie Tanner (@lat7dg), Matthew Hawthorn (@MattHawthorn), Michael Lenart (@mdlenart) and Nikhil Mascarenhas (@nm1291)\r\n","google":"UA-71154209-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
